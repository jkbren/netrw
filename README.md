# netrw: A library for network edge rewiring dynamics

This library is the result of a collaborative, open-sourced effort to provide
a single package for applying network dynamics / edge rewiring algorithms to 
graph objects in NetworkX. Broadly, these are techniques for rewiring network
edges according to some rule, property, or objective. These kinds of network
dynamics play an important (and recurring) role in contemporary Network
Science, with domain-specific applications (e.g. rewiring friendship networks
in social systems, rewiring neuronal networks in brain dynamics, etc.) as well
as theoretical / statistical applications (e.g. randomization for null models,
temporal network models, etc.).

This is a package that was developed during a *Collabathon*.
