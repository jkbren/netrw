# netrw: A library for network edge rewiring dynamics

This library is the result of a collaborative, open-sourced effort to provide
a single package for 

Network Rewiring - A NetSI 2022 Collabathon Product.

# netrd: A library for network {reconstruction, distances, dynamics}

This library provides a consistent, NetworkX-based interface to various
utilities for graph distances, graph reconstruction from time series data, and
simulated dynamics on networks.
